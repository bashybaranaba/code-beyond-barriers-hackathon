#### Project Description
##### Background
Citizen journalism refers to the act of members of the general public playing an active role in the process of collection, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information. Citizen journalism plays a significant role in governance as it promotes accountability, transparency, and civic engagement. It supports democracy and amplifies the voices of marginalized communities. However, credibility and quality control pose a major challenge. Currently, validation and verification of information gained from citizen reporting is time-consuming and is faced with limited resources.

This project aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized citizen reporting platform that employs community-driven curation to streamline the validation and verification process and ensure the accuracy and credibility of the disseminated information. 


#### Summary
The platform will allow members to submit news and information for review by the community and vote on the credibility and relevance of information submitted by other members based on their specific regions. Members can vote multiple times on an items but with after a certain period of timw which is made possible by a time-locking mechanism.
Items with a high number of votes for each region are then escalated to regional validators selected by the community, who verify the credibility and relevance of the information and further escalate the matter.

#### Next Steps
To turn this prototype to a working solution the UI needs to be improved and provide better error handling.
The prototype does not take into account the members regions. The next ste would be to include this so that members can post and vote on issues relevant to their regions
